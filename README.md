# Node Framework

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ConsultJL/node-framework/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ConsultJL/node-framework)

A framework that I use when creating a new Nodejs based site

It includes: 
- nconf for configuration changes
- express as the basis for the server
- handlebars as the view engine
